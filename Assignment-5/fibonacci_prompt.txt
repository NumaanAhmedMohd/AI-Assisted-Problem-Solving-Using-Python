Write a Python function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

Requirements for the AI to produce (this is the prompt to give to an AI/code generator):

1. Provide a function named `fib(n)` which computes the nth Fibonacci number using plain recursion (no memoization in the primary implementation). The function should:
   - Accept a single integer parameter `n` (0-based indexing: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1).
   - Validate input: raise `TypeError` if `n` is not an integer; raise `ValueError` if `n` is negative.
   - Return the nth Fibonacci number as an integer.

2. Include a clear docstring for the function describing inputs, outputs, and exceptions.

3. Include inline comments explaining each step in the recursion.

4. After the plain recursive implementation, include an optional alternative implementation using memoization and comment why it is faster (keep it as a separate function `fib_memo(n)`). Clearly state in comments that memoization is optional and not the requested plain recursion.

5. Add a short section of usage examples and expected outputs (for n=0..10), and a short complexity analysis that states time and space complexity for the plain recursive approach and for the memoized version.

6. Provide a short explanation document (separate file suggested) that explains the algorithm in plain language, lists edge-cases, and gives suggestions for production use (e.g., iterative approach or using big-integer libraries if needed).

7. Add 3 simple tests (assertions) that the AI includes or suggests to verify fib(0), fib(1), fib(10).

Output format requested from the AI: 
- The code for `fib` and `fib_memo` with docstrings and comments.
- A short explanation block (or separate markdown file) containing the algorithm description and complexity.
- A short tests block that can be copy-pasted and run.

Be explicit and educational in comments and the explanation; aim for clarity for learners who are new to recursion.
