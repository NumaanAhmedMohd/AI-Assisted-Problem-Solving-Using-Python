Design a scoring system to evaluate job applicants based on their qualifications and experience. The system should:

1. Take an applicant dictionary containing features like:
   - years_experience: float
   - education_level: string ('high_school', 'bachelors', 'masters', 'phd')
   - relevant_skills: list of strings
   - past_performance_score: float (0-100)
   - certifications: list of strings
   - projects_completed: integer
   - technical_assessment_score: float (0-100)
   - communication_score: float (0-100)

2. Return a score between 0-100 that ranks candidates objectively.

3. Include weights or importance factors for different criteria.

4. Handle missing or partial data gracefully.

5. Document the scoring logic and rationale.

Requirements:
- Focus on job-relevant features only
- Avoid using protected attributes (age, gender, race, etc.)
- Use clear, explainable scoring rules
- Include input validation
- Add unit tests with example candidates
- Document any assumptions

Example expected output:
```python
def score_applicant(applicant: dict) -> float:
    """Score an applicant based on their qualifications.
    Returns a float 0-100.
    """
    # scoring implementation
    pass

# Example usage:
applicant = {
    'years_experience': 5.0,
    'education_level': 'masters',
    'relevant_skills': ['python', 'machine_learning'],
    'technical_assessment_score': 85.0
}
score = score_applicant(applicant)
```

Please provide:
1. The scoring function with comments
2. Example test cases
3. Documentation of the scoring methodology
4. Input validation rules
5. Handling of missing data
