# Calculator Examples

Two versions of a small calculator are provided:

- `calculator_manual.py` — Functions documented manually using NumPy-style
  docstrings, including examples.
- `calculator_ai.py` — Functions with module- and function-level docstrings
  generated by an AI assistant.

Try them from PowerShell:

```powershell
python "c:\AIPP\Assignment-9\calculator_manual.py"
python "c:\AIPP\Assignment-9\calculator_ai.py"
```

Both scripts include `if __name__ == "__main__"` examples that print quick
sanity-check outputs.
